# `Manifold`

An experiment in [quantitative type theory][] inspired by [@bentnib][] & [@pigworker][], using a [proof refinement][]â€“style approach due to [@beka_valentine][].

## Goals

- Understand QTT better than I do at time of writing
- Practice skills involved in working with languages: DSLs, effects, parsing, typechecking, evaluation, etc.
